This repository is for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. 
Here we have been instructed to prepare a tidy data set for analysis.

Dataset Used- Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files Included - 
  1. CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
  2. run_analysis.R prepares data using the required 5 steps:
      a) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      b) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
      c) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      d) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
      e) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
      
After executing all the steps in run_analysis.R, prepared data is exported to data.txt.
